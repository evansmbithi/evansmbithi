👋 Hi, My name is Evans Mbithi, an API-first software engineer and problem-solver, based in Nairobi, Kenya.
      I design, develop and test software applications that meet end-user requirements at scale. I also help companies comply with
      industry standard technologies. Hence driving digital transformation and making businesses more profitable. 
      
👀 I am mostly fascinated about the actor model of concurrency with Scala - a scalable language
      that compiles on the JVM. I fell in love with Scala because it addresses the demanding (scalability) needs
      of modern systems, that common programming practices do not properly address. Aside from that 
      I have had fun building with python, javascript and PHP for hobby projects and freelance. 
      
🌱 I’m currently learning by solving problems</br>

- Stack: Scala | Python | JavaScript | PHP | GCP | Azure

DISCLAIMER: I do not publish client work in public repositories. </br>
            Everything available here is a hobby project! </br>
