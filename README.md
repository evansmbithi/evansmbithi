👋 Hi, My name is Evans Mbithi, a cloud-native and API-first problem-solver, based in Nairobi, Kenya.
      I write purpose-driven code and believe in tech as a force for good. No better way to live my purpose than using my skills for the glory of God. 
      
👀 I am mostly fascinated about the actor model of concurrency with Scala - a scalable language
      that compiles on the JVM. I fell in love with Scala because it addresses the demanding (scalability) needs
      of modern systems, that common programming practices do not properly address. Aside from that 
      I have had fun building with Java, python, javascript and PHP for hobby projects and freelance. 
      
🌱 I’m currently learning by solving problems</br>

- Stack: Scala | Python | JavaScript | Java

Check out stuff that I make in my free time.
