👋 Hi, My name is Evans Mbithi, a cloud-native and API-driven problem-solver, based in Nairobi, Kenya.
      I design, develop, test and deploy software applications that meet end-user requirements at scale. I also assist companies adapt to
      industry standard technologies. Hence driving digital transformation and making businesses more profitable. 
      
👀 I am mostly fascinated about the actor model of concurrency with Scala - a scalable language
      that compiles on the JVM. I fell in love with Scala because it addresses the demanding (scalability) needs
      of modern systems, that common programming practices do not properly address. Aside from that 
      I have had fun building with Java, python, javascript and PHP for hobby projects and freelance. 
      
🌱 I’m currently learning by solving problems</br>
