👋 Hi, My name is Evans Mbithi, an (API-first) software engineer based in Nairobi, Kenya. <br/>
      I exercise concepts of computer systems to design, develop and test software <br/>
      applications that meet end-user requirements. I also help companies comply with <br/>
      industry standard and cutting-edge technologies. Hence driving digital transformation <br/> 
      and making businesses more profitable. 
      
👀 I am mostly fascinated about the actor model of concurrency with scala - a scalable language <br/> 
      that compiles on the JVM. I fell in love with scala because it addresses the demanding needs <br/> 
      of modern systems, that common programming practices do not properly address, especially in this <br/> 
      era of cloud computing and scalability. Aside from that I have had fun building with python, <br/> 
      javascript and PHP for hobby projects and freelance. 
      
🌱 I’m currently learning by solving problems</br>

- Stack: Scala | Python | JavaScript | C++ | GCP | Azure

DISCLAIMER: I do not publish client work in public repositories. </br>
            All that there is to see here are hobby projects! </br>
